# What is This?
Looking through old notes, I found my old writeup on Space Complexity I did for my first CS Theory class that I took in Fall 2021.
Space complexity was my first fascination in complexity theory, so I thought it would be fun to share my writeup here. I have not edited it since I wrote it, so it is a bit rough around the edges. I hope you enjoy the memes!
